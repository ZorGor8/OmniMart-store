OmniMart: A Modern E-commerce Platform
This project is a single-page e-commerce application built with modern front-end technologies. The goal was to create a clean, responsive, and highly usable online store front with a focus on core features and an elegant user experience.

Key Features
Product Catalog: The site displays a variety of products across different categories, including electronics and jewelry.

Dynamic Product Filtering: Users can browse products by category, which dynamically updates the displayed items.

Search Functionality: A functional search bar allows users to quickly find products by name.

Shopping Cart: Users can add products to a shopping cart and see the total number of items, providing a seamless shopping experience.

Contact Page: A dedicated contact page provides essential business information, including contact details and address.

Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive and provides an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Technologies Used
React: Used for building a component-based, maintainable, and scalable user interface.

TypeScript: Implemented for static type-checking to enhance code quality and reduce bugs.

Vite: Utilized as a fast build tool for a streamlined development experience.

Tailwind CSS: Employed for a utility-first approach to styling, enabling rapid and consistent UI development.

Font Awesome (SVG): Integrated for high-quality, scalable icons to enhance the visual appeal.

Future Improvements
While this project focuses on the front-end, it is designed to be easily integrated with a back-end database like Firestore to handle product inventory, user accounts, and order processing. This would allow for the storage of product images and real-time data synchronization.
